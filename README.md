# Raspberry Pi Network Test

This script is used to run a ping on the selected servers, which will return a response.

In this instance, this will ping the following:

8.8.8.8 (Google Public DNS)
192.168.1.97 (snowmoon)
192.168.1.238 (wolfmoon)

If the ping response is OK, this will return the following:

However, if there is any connection issues, this will return the following message:

Unable to connect to: 192.168.1.97 (snowmoon) Please check the connection and try again.
